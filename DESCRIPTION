Description: Areal Disease Analysis and Predicion Tools assimilates disease spread data for COVID-19, and other similar diseases, in order to estimate model parameters of disease transmission. The model used here is an adaptation of a classical epidemiological model (SIR) using Bayesian methods (MCMC via STAN). Simulation/forcasting of disease progression is conducted using stochastic simulation approaches (via the Gillespie method). Small area-based approach using CAR/BYM models are also used to model and support spatial smoothing and analysis.
